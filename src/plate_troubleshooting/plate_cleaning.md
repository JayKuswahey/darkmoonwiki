# Clean. Your. Plate.

## Intro

90% of the time, warping and lack of adhesion are caused by dirty build plates.

Your build plate depends on interesting interactions of heat and chemistry to bond your filament while printing, but let it go when cooled. None of that works if your build plate is covered in contaminants.

The most common contaminants are oils from your hands, contamination from other prints, and other contaminants from the environment. Open printers like the A1 are especially prone to environmental contamination.

## IPA wipe

> [!NOTE]
> No, wiping with IPA isn't considered cleaning

Wiping with IPA is more like sweeping; it can remove some surface contaminants, but it's not _cleaning_. If there's enough crud on the plate, you're more likely to just dilute it and spread it around than remove it.

This is an extreme example of what happens when you wipe with IPA instead of cleaning. This is the _bottom surface of a print_ on a plate that was wiped with IPA instead of being properly cleaned.

## Steps of cleaning with dish soap

1. Remove the plate from the printer.
2. Clean the plate according to the plate's [cleaning instructions](https://darkmoon3d.com/pages/plate-comparison) (generally Dawn/Fairy/Dreft dish soap, _hot_ water, not luke, and a clean nylon dish brush, scrubber or sponge).
3. Let the plate dry completely, or dry it with a lint-free paper towel.
4. Do not touch the plate with your bare hands.
5. Reinstall the plate on the printer.

### Video of cleaning the plate

Here's how JayKay handles his plates in the tub. Please note that he's also doing it wrong, he's wiping, not dabbing... `*sigh*` :P
